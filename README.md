A Full-Stack Capstone Project by Abigayle Jones - NSS 2023



## Purpose
Metrolpo-List is a place to store all the to-dos and thoughts people need to keep track of daily life. Phone numbers scattered over junk mail, sticky notes wedged in random notebooks, it can get hard to track everything that needs to be done. Metropo-List not only can store all your to-dos in one place, but you can also tag lists by their genre, and see all the tasks related to that list. You can also attach notes to your lists so If you need to say, make a call, the phone number is easily accessible.  
## How It Works
### As a User
Users have the ability to look at their own notes, their own to-do dockets, and their own profile.

### As an Admin
Admins have the same abilities as users, but from the home page, they can also access a list of a the users, a list of all the tags, a list of all dockets, as well as the ability to create tags.

## Development
This is a full-stack application. The server-side is built in C# utilizing SwaggerAPI. The client-side of the application is built in React and utilizes TailwindCSS for styling. 

## Challenges
The main difficulty for me in building this project was the amount of files needed. This is probably one of my largest projects yet, so just getting used to full-stack and building a huge file structure took some getting used to. Overall, I enjoyed making this application and plan to personally use it in the future.
